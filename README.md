The Gaming Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a company that currently had a game called Draw It or Lose It, which was available only for Android. They wanted to take the concept of their current game to a multi-platform application that allowed teams to guess what was being drawn in real time, based on the stock drawing from the game's large library. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did an exploratory analysis of the design constraints, the template for the domain model, development tools, client side restrictions and distrubited system and networks. 
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would add more the operating platform and analyze this on a deeper scale, as I wasn't entirely sold on what client platform to support, and/or what mobile applications to consider. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I started to interpret the user's needs based on what the application was trying to accomplish. If the user has an allotted amount of time to draw the photo, then the photo needs to load quickly from the library. In turn, the application needed to have a top of the line security system to protect the users, as well as encrypted storage and memory management. These things were easy to determine based on the rate that things need to load to keep the game running smoothly and avoid lag times. It's important to consider what both the application is trying to accomplish, and what the user might need when trying to design an application. As the user, you want an application that runs quickly, flawlessly, without lag, while keeping your personal details securely locked away. If an application can't support these key items for the user, then creating them for the client is almost useless. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I typically use the bottom up design model when I am trying to design any sort of software application, as I find it easiest to consider all of the basic components that I need, and then using those as building blocks for the necessary higher-level components.
